<h3>Description:</h3> An application for managing Yandex smart devices on a computer, similar in interface and capabilities to the 

[mobile version](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC-%D1%81-%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B9/id1582810683)


<h3>Technologies:</h3>

- Yandex OAuth 2.0, Yandex API (IOT)
- Python (CustomTkinter and a few others) - frontend (client part)
- Python (several different libraries for API communication,

  main one - requests) - backend (client part)

- Python (Flask, requests, etc.) - authorization (server part)
- OS - Windows
- Auto-py-to-exe, Pyinstaller, Inno setup compiler - exe file and installer

<h3>Capabilities:</h3>

- View all connected devices
- Turning on/off some devices
- Running scenarios

and more

<h3>Plans:</h3>

- Build the project for Linux, MacOS(?)
- Rewrite the interface in HTML etc., probably in React JS because current libraries are slow and inconvenient for coding
- Add support for a larger number of device types

  (currently, most are simply displayed, without the possibility, and therefore without a switch for turning on/off and setting)

<h3>Interface:</h3>
